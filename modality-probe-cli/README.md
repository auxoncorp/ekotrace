# modality-probe-cli
The purview / responsibility of the cli in the context of the greater modality ecosystem

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
The CLI requires a Rust toolchain. The recommended toolchain
management system for Rust is [Rustup](https://rustup.sh).

### Building
Once Rust is installed (don’t forget to follow directions about
setting up `$PATH`), clone this repository and use Cargo to build it
locally:

```shell
$ cd modality-probe/modality-probe-cli
$ cargo install --path .
```

This will deposit a file at
`modality-probe/target/release/modality-probe` that can be run
directly.

## Usage

```
Modality probe command line interface

USAGE:
	modality-probe <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
	-h, --help   	Prints help information
	-V, --version	Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
	export      	Export a collected event log in a well-known graph format
	header-gen  	Generate Rust/C header files with event/probe id constants
	help        	Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
	manifest-gen	Generate event and probe id manifest files from probe macro invocations

```


### Export
```
modality-probe-export 0.3.0
Export a collected as a Graphviz dot file

USAGE:
    modality-probe export [FLAGS] <graph-type> --components <components>... --report <report>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help
            Prints help information
    -i, --interactions-only
            Generate the graph showing only the causal relationships, eliding the events inbetween
    -V, --version
            Prints version information


OPTIONS:
    -c, --components <components>...
            The path to a component directory. To include multiple components, provide this switch
            multiple times
    -r, --report <report>
            The path to the collected trace

ARGS:
    <graph-type>
            The type of graph to output.

            This can be either `cyclic` or `acyclic`. A cyclic graph is one which shows the
            possible paths from either an event or a probe. An acyclic graph shows the causal
            history of either all events or the interactions between probes in the system.
```

```
$ modality-probe export acyclic \
    --components my-component \
    --report session_8_log_entries.csv > complete.dot
```

Export provides a way to convert your collected trace into a Graphviz
dot graph.

### Manifest Generation

```
modality-probe-manifest-gen 0.3.0
Generate component, event and probe manifest files from probe macro invocations

USAGE:
    modality-probe manifest-gen [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <source-path>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help
            Prints help information
        --regen-component-id
            Regenerate the component IDs instead of using existing IDs (if present)
    -V, --version
            Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --component-name <component-name>
            Component name used when generating a component manifest [default: component]
        --event-id-offset <event-id-offset>
            Event ID offset, starts at 1 if not specified
        --file-extension <file-extensions>...
            Limit the source code searching to files with matching extensions
    -l, --lang <lang>
            Language (C or Rust), if not specified then guess based on file extensions
    -o, --output-path <output-path>
            Output path where component files are generated [default: component]
        --probe-id-range <probe-id-range>
            Constrain the generated probe ID to an specific range.
            This can be either `<inclusive_start>..<exclusive_end>` or
            `<inclusive_start>..=<inclusive_end>`.
            The range values are unsigned 32-bit integers and must be non-zero.

ARGS:
    <source-path>
            Source code path to search
```
```
$ modality-probe manifest-gen .
```

Manifest generation works by exploring your source code looking for
probe initialization and event recordings. It then generates a CSV
file that containing the event name, its autogenerated id, as well as
other metadata about the event. This CSV file then serves two
purposes: it is used for generating headers files that contain event
and probe definitions which you can read about in the following
section, and secondly, it also be used when interacting with a trace
after it’s been collected, such as with the `export` command, to
convert the raw ids back to human-readable formats.

### Header Generation

```
modality-probe-header-gen 0.3.0
Generate Rust/C header files with event/probe id constants

USAGE:
    modality-probe header-gen [OPTIONS] <component-path>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --include-guard-prefix <include-guard-prefix>
            C header include guard prefix. [default: MODALITY_PROBE]
    -l, --lang <lang>
            The language to output the source in, either `c' or `rust' [default: C]
    -o, --output-path <output-path>
            Write output to file (instead of stdout)

ARGS:
    <component-path>    Component path
```
```
$ modality-probe header-gen -o include/probes.h my-component
```

`header-gen` generates the Rust or C files containing the definitions
for your events and probes. As stated in the previous section, events
and probes, at runtime, use an autogenerated id—an unsigned 32-bit
integer. With `header-gen` you get to use their textual name in your
code, and their name to id mappings are handled through code
generation via this command, and `manifest-gen` before before it.

**Note:** you’ll need to run `header-gen` _before_ compilation to give
definitions for those otherwise undefined symbols.
