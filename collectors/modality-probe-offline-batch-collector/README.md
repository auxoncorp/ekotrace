# modality-probe-offline-batch-collector

Convert binary report blobs into log files.

## Overview

The offline batch collector is a utility for converting batches
of binary report blobs into log files. It serializes the incoming
reports into json lines and writes those lines to a file.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* [Rust Toolchain](https://rustup.rs)

### Building
Once Rust is installed (donâ€™t forget to follow directions about
setting up `$PATH`), clone this repository and use Cargo to build it
locally:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:auxoncorp/modality-probe
cd collectors/modality-probe-offline-batch-collector
cargo build --release
```

This will deposit a file at
`modality-probe/target/release/modality-probe-offline-batch-collector` that can
be run directly.

## Usage
